Hivemind
========

The python micro service prototyping sandbox on a budget!

    Excuse the appearance while we flesh out a whole bunch of this system. If you want to get the code right away `grab it here`_

The paradigm for service/subscription processes is not new. In fact, it's become quite common in utilities like RabbitMQ, ROS (Robot Operating System) and others.

``hivemind`` seeks to add a few features to that paradigm.

1. Insanely fast development throughput with little to know need to understand the "under-the-hood" components
2. Lean-and-mean data layer(s) to help organize your data without any concrete overhead
3. **(Most importantly)** - we want to make it nearly impossible to take down.
